  Runs a shell command in the cwd. This tool uses /bin/sh. Do NOT use bash-isms; they won't work.
  Only use POSIX-compliant shell.

  The shell command is run as a subshell, not connected to a PTY, so don't run interactive commands:
  only run commands that will work headless.

  Do NOT attempt to pipe echo, printf, etc commands to work around this. If it's interactive, either
  figure out a non-interactive variant to run instead, or if that's impossible, as a last resort you
  can ask the user to run the command, explaining that it's interactive.

  Often interactive commands provide flags to run them non-interactively. Prefer those flags.
